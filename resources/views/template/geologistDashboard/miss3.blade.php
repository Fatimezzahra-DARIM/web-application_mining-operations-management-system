<h2 class="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-dark">The office geologist or geoinformatics professional is a person who uses computer tools and geospatial technologies to analyze and interpret geological data. Their main activities include:</h2>
<ol class=" space-y-1 text-gray-500 list-decimal list-inside dark:text-gray-800">
    <li><span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-black">Data collection and management:</span> The office geologist collects, processes, and manages geological data using specialized software to create geological maps, terrain models, and geological databases.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-black">Data analysis: </span>The office geologist analyzes geological data to understand the geological structure of a site, ongoing geological processes, potential geological hazards, and natural resources.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-black">Geological modeling</span> The office geologist uses geological modeling software to create 3D models of the geological structure of a site, which helps to better understand the distribution and characteristics of rock layers and minerals.</li>
    <li><span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-black">Mapping and visualization: </span> The office geologist uses mapping and visualization tools to create geological maps and digital terrain models that help to better understand the geology of a site.</li>
